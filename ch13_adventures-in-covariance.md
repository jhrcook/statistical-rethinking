Chapter 13. Adventures in Covariance
================

  - this chapter will show how to specify *varying slopes* in
    combination with varying intercepts
      - enables pooling to improve estimates of how different units
        respond to or are influenced by predictor variables
      - also improves the estimates of intercepts by “borrowing
        information across parameter types”
      - “varying slope models are massive interaction machines”

## 13.1 Varying slopes by construction

  - pool information across intercepts and slopes by modeling the joint
    population of intercepts and slopes
      - modeling their covariance
      - assigning a 2D Gaussian distribution to both the intercepts
        (first dimension) and the slopes (second dimension)
  - the variance-covariance matrix for a fit model describes how each
    parameters posterior probability is associated with one another
      - varying intercepts have variation, varying slopes have
        variation, and intercepts and slopes covary
  - use example of visiting coffee shops:
      - visit different cafes, order a coffee, and record the wait time
          - previously, used varying intercepts, one for each cafe
      - also record the time of day
          - the average wait time is longer in the mornings than
            afternoons because they are busier in the mornings
      - different cafes vary in their average wait times and their
        differences between morning and afternoon
          - the differences in wait time by time of day are the slopes
      - cafes covary in their intercepts and slopes
          - because the popular cafes have much longer wait times in the
            morning leading to large differences between morning and
            afternoon

\[
\mu_i = \alpha_{\text{cafe}[i]} + \beta_{\text{cafe}[i]} A_i
\]

## 13.1.1 Simulate the population

  - define the population of cafes
      - define the average wait time in the morning and afternoon
      - define the correlation between them

<!-- end list -->

``` r
a <- 3.5        # average morning wait time
b <- -1         # average difference afternoon wait time
sigma_a <- 1    # standard deviation in intercepts
sigma_b <- 0.5  # standard deviation in slopes
rho <- -0.7     # correlation between intercepts and slopes
```

  - use these values to simulate a sample of cafes
      - define the multivariate Gaussian with a vecotr of means and a
        2x2 matrix of variances and covariances

<!-- end list -->

``` r
Mu <- c(a, b)  # vector of two means
```

  - the matrix of variances and covariances is arranged as follows

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma_\alpha^2 & \sigma_\alpha \sigma_\beta \rho \\
\sigma_\alpha \sigma_\beta \rho & \sigma_\beta^2
\end{pmatrix}
\]

  - can construct the matrix explicitly

<!-- end list -->

``` r
cov_ab <- sigma_a * sigma_b * rho
Sigma <- matrix(c(sigma_a^2, cov_ab, cov_ab, sigma_b^2), nrow = 2)
Sigma
```

    #>       [,1]  [,2]
    #> [1,]  1.00 -0.35
    #> [2,] -0.35  0.25

  - another way to build the variance-covariance matrix using matrix
    multiplication
      - this is likely a better approach with larger models

<!-- end list -->

``` r
sigmas <- c(sigma_a, sigma_b)
Rho <- matrix(c(1, rho, rho, 1), nrow = 2)
Sigma <- diag(sigmas) %*% Rho %*% diag(sigmas)
Sigma
```

    #>       [,1]  [,2]
    #> [1,]  1.00 -0.35
    #> [2,] -0.35  0.25

  - now can simulate 20 cafes, each with their own intercept and slope

<!-- end list -->

``` r
N_cafes <- 20
```

  - simulate from a multivariate Gaussian using `mvnorm()` from the
    ‘MASS’ package
      - returns a matrix of
        \(\text{cafe} \times (\text{intercept}, \text{slope})\)

<!-- end list -->

``` r
library(MASS)

set.seed(5)
vary_effects <- mvrnorm(n = N_cafes, mu = Mu, Sigma = Sigma)
head(vary_effects)
```

    #>          [,1]       [,2]
    #> [1,] 4.223962 -1.6093565
    #> [2,] 2.010498 -0.7517704
    #> [3,] 4.565811 -1.9482646
    #> [4,] 3.343635 -1.1926539
    #> [5,] 1.700971 -0.5855618
    #> [6,] 4.134373 -1.1444539

``` r
# Split into separate vectors for ease of use later.
a_cafe <- vary_effects[, 1]
b_cafe <- vary_effects[, 2]
cor(a_cafe, b_cafe)
```

    #> [1] -0.5721537

  - plot of the varying effects

<!-- end list -->

``` r
as.data.frame(vary_effects) %>%
    as_tibble() %>%
    set_names(c("intercept", "slope")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = intercept, y = slope)) +

### 13.1.2 Simulate observations

  - simulate the visits to each cafe
      - 10 visits to each cafe, 5 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon

<!-- end list -->

``` r
N_visits <- 10
afternoon <- rep(0:1, N_visits * N_cafes / 2)
cafe_id <- rep(1:N_cafes, each = N_visits)

# Get the average wait time for each cafe in the morning and afternoon.
mu <- a_cafe[cafe_id] + b_cafe[cafe_id] * afternoon

sigma <- 0.5  # Standard deviation within cafes

# Sample wait times with each cafes unique average wait time per time of day.
wait_times <- rnorm(N_visits*N_cafes, mu, sigma)

d <- tibble(cafe = cafe_id, afternoon, wait = wait_times)
d
```

    #> # A tibble: 200 x 3
    #>     cafe afternoon  wait
    #>    <int>     <int> <dbl>
    #>  1     1         0  5.00

### 13.1.3 The varying slopes model

  - model with varying intercepts and slopes (explination follows)

$$ W\_i (\_i, ) \\

*i = *{\[i\]} + \_{\[i\]} A\_i \\

(

,  ) \\

\=

\\

(0,10) \\ (0,10) \\ (0, 1) \\ *(0, 1) \\ *(0, 1) \\  (2) $$

  - the third like defines the population of varying intercepts and
    slopes
      - each cafe has an intercept and slope with a prior distribution
        defined by the 2D Gaussian distribution with means \(\alpha\)
        and \(\beta\) and covariance matrix \(\text{S}\)

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
    \alpha_\text{cafe} \\
    \beta_\text{cafe}
\end{bmatrix} \sim \text{MVNormal}(
    \begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix}, \textbf{S}
)
\]

  - the next line defines the variance-covariance matrix \(\textbf{S}\)
      - factoring it into simple standard deviations \(\sigma_\alpha\)
        and \(\sigma_\beta\) and a correlation matrix \(\textbf{R}\)
      - there are other ways to do this, but this formulation helps
        understand the inferred structure of the varying effects

\[
\textbf{S} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
    \sigma_\alpha & 0 \\ 0 &\sigma_\beta
\end{pmatrix}
\textbf{R}
\begin{pmatrix} 
    \sigma_\alpha & 0 \\ 0 &\sigma_\beta
\end{pmatrix}
\]

  - the correlation matrix has a prior defined as
    \(\textbf{R} \sim \text{LKJcorr}(2)\)
      - the correlation matrix will have the structure:
        \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho \\ \rho & 1 \end{pmatrix}\) where
        \(\rho\) is the correlation between the intercepts and slopes
      - with additional varying slopes, there are more correlation
        parameters, but the \(\text{LKJcorr}\) prior will still work
      - the \(\text{LKJcorr}(2)\) prior defines a weakly informative
        prior on \(\rho\) that is skeptical of extreeme correlations
        near -1 and 1
      - it has a single parameter \(\eta\) that controls how “skeptical”
        the prior is of large corrleations
          - if \(\eta=1\), the prior is flat from -1 to 1
          - a large value of \(\eta\) the mass of the distribution moves
            towards 0

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tibble(eta = c(1, 2, 4)) %>%
    mutate(value = map(eta, ~ rlkjcorr(1e5, K = 2, eta = .x)[, 1, 2])) %>%

  - consider the shrinkage
      - the inferred correlation between varying effects pooled
        information across them
      - and the inferred variation within each varying effect was pooled
      - together the variances and correlation define a multivariate
        Gaussian prior for the varying effects
      - this prior regularizes the intercepts and slopes
  - plot the posterior mean varying effects

## 13.2 Example: Admission decisions and gender

  - return to the admissions data and use varying slopes
      - help appreciate how variation in slopes arises
      - and how correlation between intercepts and slopes can provide
        insight into the underlying process
  - from previous models of the `UCBadmit` data:
      - important to have varying means across department otherwise, get
        wrong inference about gender
      - did not account for variation in how departments treat male and
        female applications

<!-- end list -->

``` r
data("UCBadmit")
d <- as_tibble(UCBadmit) %>%

  - interpretation
      - effect of male is similar that found in Chapter 10 (“Counting
        and Classification”)
          - the intercept is effectively uninteresting, if perhaps
            slightly negative
      - because we included the global mean \(\alpha\) in the prior for
        the varying intercepts, the `a_dept[i]` values are all
        deviations from `a`

### 13.2.2 Varying effects of being male

  - now we can consider the variation in gender bias among departments
      - use varying slopes
  - the data is *imbalanced*
      - the sample sizes vary a lot across departments
      - pooling will have a stronger effect for cases with fewer
        applicants

  - focus on what the addition of varying slopes has revealed
      - plot below shows marginal posterior distributions for the
        varying effects
      - the intercepts are quite varied, but the slopes are all quite
        close to 0
          - suggests that the departments had different rates of
            admissions, but none discriminated between male and females
          - one standout is the slope for deptartment 1 which suggests
            some bias against females
              - department 1 also has the largest intercept, so look
                into the correlation between slopes and intercepts next

  - interpretation:
      - the model with no slope for differences in gender `m13_4`
        performs the same out-of-sample performance as the model with a
        single slope for a constant effect of gender `m13_2`
      - the model with varying slopes suggests that even though the
        slope is near zero, it is worth modeling as a separate
        distribution

## 13.3 Example: Cross-classified chimpanzees with varying slopes

  - use chimpanzee data to model multiple varying intercepts and/or
    slopes
      - varying intercepts for `actor` and `block`
      - varying slopes for prosocial option and the interaction between
        prosocial and the prescence of another chimpanzee
  - *non-centered parameterization* (see later for explination and
    example)
      - there are always several ways to formulate a model that are
        mathematically equivalent
      - however, they can result in different sampling results, so the
        parameterization is part of the model
  - cross-classified varing slopes model
      - use multiple linear models to compartmentalize sub-models for
        the intercepts and each slope
      - \(\mathcal{A}_i\), \(\mathcal{B}_{P,i}\), and
        \(\mathcal{B}_{PC,i}\) are the sub-models

\[
L_i \sim \text{Binomial}(1, p_i) \\
\text{logit}(p_i) = \mathcal{A}_i + (\mathcal{B}_{p,i} + \mathcal{B}_{PC,i} C_i) P_i \\
\mathcal{A}_i = \alpha + \alpha_{\text{actor}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{block}[i]} \\
\mathcal{B}_{P,i} = \beta_P + \beta_{P,\text{actor}[i]} + \beta_{P,\text{block}[i]} \\
\mathcal{B}_{PC,i} = \beta_P + \beta_{PC,\text{actor}[i]} + \beta_{PC,\text{block}[i]} \\
\]

  - below is the formulation for the multivariate priors
      - one multivariate Gaussian per cluster of the data (`actor` and
        `block`)
      - for this model, each is 3D, one for each variable in the model
          - this can be adjusted to have different varying effects in
            different cluster types
      - these priors state that the actors and blocks come from
        different statistical populations
          - within each, three features for each actor or block are
            related through a covariance matrix for the population
            (\(\textbf{S}\))
          - the mean for each prior is 0 because there is an average
            value in the linear models already (\(\alpha\), \(\beta_P\),
            and \(\beta_{PC,i}\))

  - there was an issue with the HMC sampling
      - can often just do more sampling to get over it, but other times
        the chains may not converge
      - this is where *non-centered parameterization* can help

  - usee *non-centered parameterization* to help with potentially
    diverging chains
      - use an alternative parameterization of the model using
        `dmvnormNC()`
      - mathematically equivalent to the first
