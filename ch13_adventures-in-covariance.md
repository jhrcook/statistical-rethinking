Chapter 13. Adventures in Covariance
================

  - this chapter will show how to specify *varying slopes* in
    combination with varying intercepts
      - enables pooling to improve estimates of how different units
        respond to or are influenced by predictor variables
      - also improves the estimates of intercepts by “borrowing
        information across parameter types”
      - “varying slope models are massive interaction machines”
