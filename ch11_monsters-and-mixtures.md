Chapter 11. Monsters and Mixtures
================

  - build more types of models by piecing together types we have already
    learned about
      - will discuss *ordered categorical* models and
        *zero-inflated*/*zero-augmented* models
  - mixtures are powerful, but interpretation is difficult

## 11.1 Ordered categorical outcomes

  - the outcome is discrete and has different *levels* along a dimension
    but the differences between each level are not necessarily equal
      - is a multinomial prediction problem with a constraint on the
        order of the categories
      - want an estimate of the effect of a change in a predictor on the
        change along the categories
  - use a *cumulative link function*
      - the cumulative probability of a value is *the probability of
        that value or any smaller value*
      - this guarantees the ordering of the outcomes

### 11.1.1 Example: Moral intuition

  - example data come from a survey of people with different versions of
    the classic “Trolley problem”
      - 3 versions that invoke different moral principles: “action
        principle,” “intention principle,” and “contact principle”
      - the goal is how people just the different choices from the
        different principles
      - `response`: from an integer 1-7, how morally permissible is the
        action

<!-- end list -->

``` r
data("Trolley")
d <- as_tibble(Trolley) %>%
    rename(q_case = case)
```

### 11.1.2 Describing an ordered distribution with intercepts

  - some plots of the data
      - a histogram of the response values
      - cumulative proportion of responses
      - log-cumulative-odds of responses

<!-- end list -->

``` r
p1 <- d %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
    labs("Distribution of response")

p2 <- d %>% 
    count(response) %>%
    mutate(prop = n / sum(n),
           cum_prop = cumsum(prop)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = response, y = cum_prop)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    labs(y = "cumulative proportion")

p3 <- d %>% 
    count(response) %>%
    mutate(prop = n / sum(n),
           cum_prop = cumsum(prop),
           cum_odds = cum_prop / (1 - cum_prop),
           log_cum_odds= log(cum_odds)) %>%
    filter(is.finite(log_cum_odds)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = response, y = log_cum_odds)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    labs(y = "log-cumulative-odds")

p1 | p2 | p3
```

  - why use the log-cumulative-odds of each response:
      - it is the cumulative analog of the logit link used previously
      - the logit is the log-odds; the cumulative logit is the
        log-cumulative-odds
      - constrains the probabilities to between 0 and 1
      - this link function takes care of converting the parameter
        estimates to the probability scale
  - to use Bayes’ theorom to compute the posterior distribution of these
    intercepts, need to compute the likelihood of each possible response
    value
      - need to use the cumulative probabilities \(\Pr(y_i \ge k)\) to
        compute the likelihood \(\Pr(y_i = k)\)
      - use the inverse link to translate the log-cumulative-odds back
        to cumulative probability
      - therefore, when we observe \(k\) and need its likelihoood, just
        use subtraction:
          - the values are shown as blue lines in the next plot

\[
p_k = \Pr(y_i = k) = \Pr(y_i \le k) - \Pr(y_i \le k - 1)
\]

``` r
offset_subtraction <- function(x) {
    y <- x
    for (i in seq(1, length(x))) {
        if (i == 1) { 
            y[[i]] <- x[[i]]
        } else {
            y[[i]] <- x[[i]] - x[[i - 1]]
        }
    }
    return(y)
}

d %>% 
    count(response) %>%
    mutate(prop = n / sum(n),
           cum_prop = cumsum(prop),
           likelihood = offset_subtraction(cum_prop),
           ymin = cum_prop - likelihood) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
    geom_linerange(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = cum_prop), color = "grey50") +
    geom_line(aes(y = cum_prop)) +
    geom_point(aes(y = cum_prop)) +
    geom_linerange(aes(ymin = ymin, ymax = cum_prop), color = "blue",
                   position = position_nudge(x = 0.05), size = 1) +
    labs(y = "log-cumulative-odds",
         title = "Cumulative probability and ordered likelihood",

  - below is the matematical form of the model using an ordered logit
    likelihood
      - notation for these models can vary by author
      - the *Ordered* distribution is just a categorical distribution
        that takes a vector
        \(\text{p} = \{p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6\}\)
          - only 6 because the 7th level has the value 1 automatically
      - each response value \(k\) gets an intercept parameter
        \(\alpha_k\)

\[
R_i \sim \text{Ordered}(p) \\
logit(P_k) = \alpha_k \\
\alpha_k \sim \text{Normal}(0, 10)
\]

  - the first model does not include any predictor vairables
      - the link function is embedded in the likelihood function,
        already
          - simpler to type and makes the calculations more efficient,
            too
      - `phi` is a placeholder for now but will be used to add in
        predictor variables
      - the start values are included to start the intercepts in the
        right order
          - their exact values don’t really matter, just the order

### 11.1.3 Adding predictor variables

  - to include predictor variables:
      - *define the log-cumulative-odds of each response \(k\) as a sum
        of its intercept \(\alpha_k\) and a typical linear model*
      - for example: add a predictor \(x\) to the model
          - define the linear model \(\phi_i = \beta x_i\)
          - the cumulative logit becomes:

\[
\log \frac{\Pr(y_i \ge k)}{1 - \Pr(y_i \ge k)} = \alpha - \phi_i = \alpha - \beta x_i
\]

  - this form keeps the correct ordering of the outcome values while
    still morphing the likelihood of each individual value as the
    predictor \(x_i\) changes value
  - the linear model \(\phi\) is subtracted from the intercept:
      - because decreasing the log-cumulative-odds of every outcome
        value \(k\) below the maximum shifts probability mass upwards
        towards higher outcome values
      - a positive \(\beta\) value indicates than an increase in the
        predictor variable \(x\) results in an increase in the average
        response
  - for the Trolly data, we can icnlude predictor variables for the
    different types of questions: “action,” “intention,” and “contact”
      - the formulation of the log-cumulative-odds of each response
        \(k\) is shown below
      - defines the log-odds of each possible response to be an additive
        model of the features of the story corresponding to each
        response

\[
\log \frac{\Pr(y_i \ge k)}{1 - \Pr(y_i \ge k)} = \alpha - \phi_i \\
\phi_i = \beta_A A_i + \beta_I I_i + \beta_C C_i
\]

``` r
m11_2 <- quap(
    alist(
        response ~ dordlogit(phi, c(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6)),
        phi <- bA*action + bI*intention + bC*contact,
        c(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6) ~ dnorm(0, 10),
        c(bA, bI, bC) ~ dnorm(0, 10)
    ),
    data = d,
    start = list(a1 = -2, a2 = -1, a3 = 0, a4 = 1, a5 = 2, a6 = 2.5)
)
```

  - fit another model with interactions between action and intention and
    between contact and intention
      - these two make sense in terms of the scenario we are modeling
        while an interaction between contact and action does not
          - contact is a type of action

<!-- end list -->

``` r
m11_3 <- quap(
    alist(
        response ~ dordlogit(phi, c(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6)),
        phi <- bA*action + bI*intention + bC*contact + bAI*action*intention + bCI*contact*intention,
        c(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6) ~ dnorm(0, 10),
        c(bA, bI, bC, bAI, bCI) ~ dnorm(0, 10)
    ),
    data = d,
    start = list(a1 = -2, a2 = -1, a3 = 0, a4 = 1, a5 = 2, a6 = 2.5)
)

  - interpretation:
      - the intercepts are difficult to interpret on their own, but act
        like regular intercepts in simpler models
          - they are the relative frequencies of the outcomes when all
            predictors are set to 0
      - there are 5 slope parameters: 3 main effects and 2 iinteractions
          - they are all far from 0 (can check with `precis(m)`)
          - they are all negative: each factor/interaction *reduces* the
            average response
          - these values are difficult to interpret as is, so they are
            investigated more below
  - compare the models by WAIC
      - the model with interaction terms is sufficiently better than the
        other two, so we can safely proceed with just analyzing it and
        ignoring the other two

  - plot implied predictions to understand what model `m11_3` implies
      - difficult to plot the predictions of log-cumulative-odds because
        each prediction is a vector of probabilities, one for each
        possible outcome
      - as a predictor variable changes value, the entire vector changes
  - one common plot is to use the horiztonal axis for the predictor
    variable and the vertical axis for the cumulative probability
      - plot a curve for each response value

  - interpretation:
      - each horizontal line is the bounday between levels
      - the thickness of the boundary represents the variation in
        prediction
      - the change in height from intention changing from 0 to 1
        indicates the predicted impact of changing a trolley story from
        non-intention to intention
          - the left-hand plot shows that there is not much change from
            switching intention when action and contact are both 0
          - the other two plots show the interaction between intention
            and the other variable that is set to 1
          - the middle plot shows that there is a large interaction
            between contact and intention

## 11.2 Zero-inflated outcomes

  - *mixture model*: measurements arise from multiple proceesses;
    different causes for the same observation
      - uses more than one probability distribution
  - common to need to use a mixture model for count variables
      - a count of 0 can often arise in more than one way
      - a 0 could occurr because nothing happens, because the rate of
        the event is very low, or because the event-generating process
        never began
      - said to be *zero-inflated*

### 11.2.1 Example: Zero-inflated Poisson

  - previously, we use the monastery example to study the Poisson
    distribution
      - now imagine that the monks take breaks on some days and no
        manuscripts are made
      - want to estimate how often breaks are taken
  - mixture model:
      - a zero can arise from two processes:
        1.  the monks took a break
        2.  the monks workked but did not complete a manuscript
      - let \(p\) be the probability the monks took a break on a day
      - let \(\lambda\) be the mean number of manuscripts completed when
        the monks work
  - need a likelihood function that mixes these two processes:
      - the following equation says this: “The probability of observing
        a zero is the probability that the monks took a break OR (\(+\))
        the probability the monks worked AND (\(\times\)) failed to
        finish.”

\[
\Pr(0 | p, \lambda) = \Pr(\text{break} | p) + \Pr(\text{work} | p) \times \Pr(0 | \lambda) \\
\Pr(0 | p, \lambda) = p + (1-p) e^{-\lambda}
\]

  - the likelihood of a non-zero value \(y\) is below
      - the the probability that the monks work multiplied by the
        probability that the working monks produce a manuscript

\[
\Pr(y | p, \lambda) = \Pr(\text{break} | p)(0) + \Pr(\text{work} | p) \Pr(y | \lambda) \\
\Pr(y | p, \lambda) = (1 - p) \frac{\lambda^y e^{-\lambda}}{y!}
\]

  - can define `ZIPoisson` as the distribution above with parameters
    \(p\) (probability of 0) and \(\lambda\) (mean of Poisson) to
    describe the shape
      - two linear models and two link functions, one for each process

\[
y_i \sim \text{ZIPoisson}(p_i, \lambda_i) \\
\text{logit}(p_i) = \alpha_p + \beta_p x_i \\
\log(\lambda_i) = \alpha_\lambda + \beta_\lambda x_i
\]

  - need to simulate data for the monks taking breaks

<!-- end list -->

# Simulate which days the monks take breaks.

    off by the monks and the rate of manuscript production per working
    day
      - though, cannot determine whether the monks took any particular
        day off

## 11.3 Over-dispersed outcomes

  - *over-dispersion*: the variance of a variable exceededs the expected
    amount for a model
      - e.g.: for a binomial, the expected value is \(np\) and its
        variance \(np(1-p)\)
      - for a count model, this suggests that a necessary variable has
        been omitted
  - ideally, would just include the missing variable to remove
    over-dispersion, but not always the case/possible
  - two strategies for mitigating the effects of over-dispersion
      - use a *continuous mixture* model: a linear model is attached to
        a distribution of observations
          - common models: *beta-binomial* and *gamma-Poisson*
            (negative-binomial)
          - these are demonstrated in the following sections
      - employ a multilevel model (GLMM) and estimate the residuals of
        each observation and the distribution of those residuals
          - easier to fit than beta-binmial and gamma-Poisson GLMs
          - more flexible
          - handle over-dispersion and other kinds of heterogineity
            simulatneously
          - *GLMMs are covered in the next chapter*

### 11.3.1 Beta-binomial

  - beta-binomial models assumes that each binomial count observation
    has its own probability of a success
      - estimates the distribution of probabilities of success across
        cases
          - instead of a single probability of success
      - predictor variables change the shape of this distribution
        instead of directly determining the probability of each success
  - example: UCB admissions data
      - if we ignore the department, the data is very over-dispersed
          - because the departments vary a lot in baseline admission
            rates
      - therefore, ignoring the inter-department variation results in an
        incorrect inference about applicant gender
      - can fit a beta-binomial model, ignoring department
  - a beta-binomial model will assume that each row of the data has a
    unique, unobserved probability of admission
      - these probabilities of admission have a common distribution
        described by the *beta distribution*
          - use the beta distribution because it can be used to
            calculate the likelihood function that averages over the
            unknown probabilities for each observation
      - beta-distribution has 2 parameters:
        1.  \(\bar{\textbf{p}}\): average probability
        2.  \(\theta\): shape parameter
      - shape parameter describes the spread of the distribution
