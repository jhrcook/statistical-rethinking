Chapter 10. Counting and Classification
================

  - information if often thrown away by using ratios of counts instead
    of the counts themselves
      - 10/20 and 1/2 are the same ratio, but the first has more
        information
  - there is friction in using the count data instead of the proportions
      - interpretation is less intuitive
  - this chapter covers the two most popular count distributions:
    1.  *binomial regression*: model a binary classification
          - dead/alive, accept/reject 2 *poisson regression*: models
            outcome without a known maximum
          - a binomial models with a very large maximum and samll
            probability per trial
          - number of elephants in Kenya, number of people who apply to
            graduate school

## 10.1 Binomial regression

  - the following formula where \(y\) is a count, \(p\) is the
    probability of success in a trial, \(n\) is the number of trials \[
    y \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)
    \]

  - the two most common GLMs that use binomial likelihood functions:
    
    1.  *logistic regression*: data are in single-trial cases and the
        outcome is only 0 or 1
    2.  *aggregated binomial regression*: when individual trials with
        the same covariate values are aggregated together
          - the outcome can take a value of 0 or any positive integer up
            to \(n\) number of trials

  - both GLMs use the same logit link function
    
      - so both are sometimes called logistic regression and they can be
        converted between each other

## 10.1.1 Logisitc regression: Prosocial chimpanzees

  - example experimental data
      - measure the prosocial behaviour of chimps
      - a focal chimp has the option to pull two levers where the first
        only gives the focal chimp food and the other gives the focal
        chimp food, but not the other chimp
      - therefore, the focal chimp always gets food and decides if the
        other chimp gets food
      - the control condition is to not have another chimp and the
        partner condition is to have the second chimp
      - the two choices are swapped from the left and right hand sides
        to detect any handedness of the focal chimps

  - we will focus on the columns:
      - `pulled_left`: the outcome to predict
      - `prosoc_left`: a predictor for if the left-hand lever was the
        prosocial option
      - `condition`: contains a 1 for when there was a second partner
        chimp
  - the model we will fit:
      - \(L\): indicates if the left-hand lever was pulled
      - \(P\): indicates if the left-hand option was pro-social
      - \(C\): indicates whether or not the condition was with the
        partner

\[
L_i \sim \text{Binomial}(1, p_i) \\
\text{logit}(p_i) = \alpha + (\beta_P + \beta_{PC} C_i)P_i \\
\alpha \sim \text{Normal}(0, 10) \\
\beta_P \sim \text{Normal}(0, 10) \\
\beta_PC \sim \text{Normal}(0, 10)
\]

  - this model includes an interaction term for the left-hand option
    being pro-social and whether or not there is a second chimp
      - also there is no main effect of the `condition` \(C_i\) because
        we do not expect the precense of a second chimp on its own to
        predict whether the focal chimp pulls the left lever
  - the priors are gently regularizing
  - as comparitive measures of overfitting, fit two other models with
    fewer parameters
      - one with just an intercept
      - one without only th `prosoc_left` predictor (no predictor for
        `condition` whether there is a second chimp)

\[
L_i \sim \text{Binomial}(1, p_i) \\
\text{logit}(p_i) = \alpha \\
\alpha \sim \text{Normal}(0, 10)
\]

\[
L_i \sim \text{Binomial}(1, p_i) \\
\text{logit}(p_i) = \alpha + \beta_P P_i \\
\alpha \sim \text{Normal}(0, 10) \\
\beta_P \sim \text{Normal}(0, 10)
\]

  - first we will inspect the simplest model, the one with only an
    intercept

  - \(\alpha\) is on the scale of log-odds
      - to get it to probability scale, must use the inverse link
        function, the logistic
      - the ‘rethinking’ package offers the function `logisitic()` to do
        this, but below I just show the calculation for education
        reasons

  - \(\text{logistic}(0.32) \approx 0.58\) means that the probability of
    pulling the left-hand lever was 0.58 with an 89% interval of 0.54 to
    0.61
      - the chimps had a tendency to favor the left without any other

  - from the WAIC, we can see that `m10_3` likely overfits a bit because
    its WAIC is greater than `m10_2`
      - though the difference in WAIC is samll, the difference standard
        error `dSE` is very small and suggests it is a real difference
  - but `m10_3` should not just be rejected, it still reflects the
    structure of the experiment
      - we do want to see why `m10_3` performs worse than `m10_2`
  - the estimates for `m10_3` show a negative interaction term with a
    large 89% interval
      - suggests the chimps don’t care too much about the presence of
        another chimp
      - they do prefer to pull the prosocial option, though, because
        that estimate is 0.61 with an 89% interval well above 0
  - to understand the impact of the estimate 0.61 for `bp`, must
    distinguish between the *absolute effect* and the *relative effect*
      - *absolute effect*: the change in the probability of the outcome,
        depending on all of the parameters
          - tells us the practical impact of a change in a predictor
      - *relative effect*: the proportional changes induced by a change
        in the predictor
          - the author claims that this effect can be misleading because
            they ignore the other parameters
  - the relative effect:
      - consider the relative effect size of `prosoc_left` and its
        parameter `bp`
      - the customary measure of relativ effect for logisitic model is
        the *proportional change in odds*
          - just the exponent of the parameter estimate
          - it is \(\exp(0.61) \approx 1.84\) for `bp`
          - odds are the ratio of the probability an even happens to the
            probability that it does not
      - for `bp`, the logodds of pulling the left-hand level (the
        outcome variable) is increased by 0.61
          - alternatively, the odds are multiplied by 1.84
      - the difficulty with proportional odds is that the actual change
        in probability depends on the intercept and the other predictor
        variables
          - for example, consider that the intercept \(\alpha = 4\),
            then the probability of pulling the left-lever, ignoring all
            else, is \(\text{logistic}(4) = 0.98\)
          - then the increase from `bp` would be
            \(\text{logistic}(4 + 0.61) = 0.99\)
          - the difference from `bp` is really not very much on the
            absolute scale
  - the absolute effect:
      - consider the model-average posterior predictive check to get a
        sense of the absolute effect of each treatment on the
        probability of pulling the left-hand lever
          - use th `ensemble()` function to take a weighted average (by
            WAIC) over the three models
          - in the following plot, this is compared to the proportion of
            times the left-hand lever was pull by each chimp in all four
            conditions
      - interpreting the plot
          - the chimps, on average, tended to pull the prosocial option
            on the left (“1,0” and “1,1”)
          - the partner condition did not seem to matter because the
            heights of the lines did not tend to move when the condition
            was changed and hand of the lever was held constant

  - the predictions are quite poor because they are averages across all
    chimps
      - a lot of variation among individuals could mask the association
        of interest
      - we can model this variation between individuals
  - the chimps showed signs of handedness - some preferred pulling the
    left lever and others perferred pulling the right lever
      - estimate handedness as a distinct intercept for each chimp
  - below is the model to fit
      - the intercept \(\alpha\) has a subscript, one for each chimp
      - \(alpha\) is a vector of parameters

  - goal: to estimate if there is gender bias in the admissions
  - fit two models:
      - a binomial regression that models `admit` as a function of each
        applicant’s gender
          - estimates the association between gender and probability of
            admission
      - a binomial regression that models `admit` as a constant,
        ignoring gender
          - this provides a sense of any overfitting in the first model
  - below is the formula for the first model
      - \(n_{\text{admit},i}\): the applications indexed by row number
      - \(m_i\): a dummy variable for male (1) vs. female (0)

\[
n_{\text{admit},i} \sim \text{Binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\
\text{logit}(p_i) = \alpha + \beta_m m_i \\
\alpha \sim \text{Normal}(0, 10) \\
\beta_m \sim \text{Normal}(0, 10)

  - interpretation of the models:
      - the WAIC indicates that including the gender created a better
        model
      - this indicates that the gender matters a lot
          - being a male is an advantage: \(exp(0.61) \approx 1.84\)
          - the male applicant’s odds were 184% that of a female’s

  - from this plot we can see that there were only 2 deptartments with
    ower admission for females, yet the model says females should have a
    14% lower chance of admission
      - the problem is that the departments that take the most students
        had fewer applications from females
  - change our question:
      - previous question: “What are the average probabilties of
        admission for females and males *across all departments*?”
      - new question: “What is the average *difference* in probability
        of admission between females and males *within departments*?”

## 10.2 Poisson regression

  - when a binomial has a small probability of an event \(p\) and a
    large number of trials \(n\)
      - a binomial has an expected value of \(np\) and a variance
        \(np(1-p)\)
      - when \(n\) is large and \(p\) small, these become about the same
  - example:
      - employ 1000 monks in a monastery to copy manuscripts (before the
        printing press)
      - on average, one monk finishes a manuscript per day
      - but each monk is working independently and the manuscripts vary
        in length
      - so some days 3 manuscripts finish, but many days it is none
      - variance: \(np(1-p) = 1000(0.001)(1-0.001) \approx 1\)
      - this is simulated with \(1 \time 10^6\) monks below

<!-- end list -->

``` r
set.seed(0)
y <- rbinom(1e6, 1000, 1/1000)
c(mean(y), var(y))
```

    ## [1] 0.9995910 0.9979418

  - this special binomial is a *Poisson distribution*
      - useful for modeling binomial events with an unknown or very
        large number of trials \(n\)
  - the model form for a Poisson is even simpler than for a binomial or
    Gaussian
      - because there is only one parameter

\[
y \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i)
\]

  - for the GLM, the link function is the log link
      - the log link makes \(\lambda_i\) always positive
      - also implies an exponential relationship between predictors and
        the expected value

\[
y \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i) \\
\log(\lambda_i) = \alpha + \beta x_i
\]

  - \(\lambda_i\) is the expected value and commonly thought of as a
    *rate*
      - allows to make models for the *exposure* varies across cases
  - example:
      - one monastary is counting books completed per week, and another
        is counting per day
      - can analyze both in the same models even though the counts are
        aggregated over different amounts of time
      - treat \(\lambda_i\) as the number of events \(\mu\) per unit
        time (or distance) \(\tau\); \(\lambda_i = \mu / \tau\)
      - the \(\tau_i\) values are the different exposures
          - when \(\tau_i = 1\) (of some unit) then \(\log \tau_i = 0\)
            and the formula is identical to the first
          - when there are different values for the exposure (i.e. per
            day vs per week), this value currects for that

\[
y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i) \\
\log \lambda_i = \log(\frac{\mu_i}{\tau_i}) = \alpha + \beta x_i \\
\log \lambda_i = \log \mu_i - \log \tau_i = \alpha + \beta x_i \\
\log \mu_i = \log \tau_i + \alpha + \beta x_i \\
\]

### 10.2.1 Example: Oceanic tool complexity

  - setup:
      - the old island societies of Oceania provide an example of
        technological evolution
          - they made fish hooks, axes, boats, hand plows, etc.
      - theorize that larger populations develop and sustain more
        complex tool kits
      - contact rates among populations increases population size, too
  - the data and models:
      - `total_tools` is the outcome predictor
      - model the number of tools as the log of the `population`
      - the number of tools increases with `contact` rate
      - the impact of `population` counts is increased by high `contact`
        using a interaction term

  - the model formula:
      - \(P\) is `population`, \(C\) is `contact_high`
      - the priors are strongly regularizing due to the small amount of
        data

\[
T_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i) \\
\log \lambda_i = \alpha + \beta+P \log P_i + \beta_C C_i + \beta_{PC} C_i \log P_i \\
\alpha \sim \text{Normal}(0, 100) \\
\beta_P \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\beta_C \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\beta_{PC} \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1)

  - interpretation:
      - the main effect of log-population `bp` is positive and both `bc`
        and `bpc` overlap zero substantially
      - could think that log-population is reliably associated with
        total tools, but that would be incorrect
          - easy to be mislead by tables of estimates, especially with
            interaction terms
  - analyze the model by plotting counterfactual predictions
      - consider two islands with log-population of 8, but one is high
        contact and the other is low contact
      - calculate \(\lambda\), the expected tool count, for each
          - sample from the posterior, convert with the linear model,
            take the exponential to reverse the logarithm
      - can plot the difference in the number of tools and find the
        percent of samples where the high contact group had more tools
        than the low contact group

  - there is a 95% plausibilty that the high-contact island has more
    tools than the low-contact island, holding population constant
      - suggests that contact is important even though the model
        estimates are not informative

  - the MAP estimates are the same as before, so the posterior is
    approximately Gaussian
  - look at pairs plots of the posterior distributions from the MCMC
      - samples of the intercept and coefficient for contact rate are
        high correlated
      - MCMC can help overcome problems from correlated coefficients,
        though it is still best to try to avoid them
      - try centering log-population and re-fitting `m10_10_stan`
      - this removes the correlation between the intercept and
        coefficient for `contact_high`
          - the chains were also more efficient (more *effective
            samples*; larger `n_eff`)

### 10.2.3 Example: Exposure and the offset

  - use an example where the exposure varies across observations
      - e.g. length of observation, area of sampling, intensity of
        sampling
      - Poisson assumes the rate of events is constant in time or space
      - *offset*: add the logarithm of exposure to the linear model as
        another term
  - simulated data:
      - own a monastery where the monks copy books by hand
      - we know the rate at which manuscripts are completed each day
      - suppose the true rate is \(\lambda=1.5\) manuscripts per day

<!-- end list -->

``` r
set.seed(0)
num_days <- 30
y <- rpois(num_days, 1.5)
table(y)

    ## 7 8 8 4 2 1

  - are thinking of purchasing another monastery, but want to know the
    productivity of the new monastery
      - but only have data for the other monastery on a per week basis
      - suppose the daily rate of the new monastery is actually
        \(\lambda=0.5\) manuscripts per day
          - thus, the real per week rate if
            \(\lambda = 0.5 \times 7 = 3.5\)

  - compute the posterior distribution of \(\lambda\) in each monastery
      - sample from the posterior and use the linear model *without* the
        offset
      - don’t use the offset again because the parameters are already on
        the daily scale

  - interpretation
      - the MAP of the two posteriors are pretty close to the known
        rates of manuscript production per day
      - the new monastery is predicted to produce 0.6 manuscripts per
        day while the old monastery produces 1.6 per day
      - the 89% intervals are well above 0 and not overlapping
