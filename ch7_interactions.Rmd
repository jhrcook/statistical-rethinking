- so far, we have assumed that each predictor has an independent association with the mean of the outcome
    * now we will look at conditioning this estimate on another predictor using *interactions*
- fitting a model with interactions is easy, but understanding them can be harder

## 7.1 Building an interaction

- for examples, we will use information on the economy countries and geographic properties

```{r}
data("rugged")

d <- rugged
d$log_gdp <- log(d$rgdppc_2000)
dd <- d[complete.cases(d$rgdppc_2000), ]
dd <- as_tibble(dd)
```

- one perculiarity is how the GDP of a country is associated to the ruggedness of the terrain.
    * the association is opposite for African and non-African countries

```{r}
dd %>%
    mutate(is_africa = ifelse(cont_africa == 1, "Africa", "non-Africa")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = rugged, y = log_gdp)) +
    facet_wrap(~ is_africa, nrow = 1, scales = "free") +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", color = "black", lty = 2) +
    geom_point(color = "lightblue4")
```

### 7.1.1 Adding a dummy variable doesn't work

- two models to begin with:
    1. linear regression of log-GDP on ruggedness
    2. the same model with a dummy variable for the African nations

```{r}
m7_3 <- quap(
    alist(
        log_gdp ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
        mu <- a + bR*rugged,
        a ~ dnorm(8, 100),
        bR ~ dnorm(0, 1),
        sigma ~ dunif(0, 10)
    ),
    data = dd
)

m7_4 <- quap(
    alist(
        log_gdp ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
        mu <- a + bR*rugged + bA*cont_africa,
        a ~ dnorm(8, 100),
        bR ~ dnorm(0, 1),
        bA ~ dnorm(0, 1),
        sigma ~ dunif(0, 10)
    ),
    data = dd
)

precis(m7_3)
precis(m7_4)
```

```{r}
compare(m7_3, m7_4)
```

- plot the posterior distribution mean and intervals for African countries and the rest
    * we can see that the WAIC for the model with the dummy variable was lower because African countries tend to have lower GDP, not because it fit the different slope

```{r}
rugged_seq <- seq(-1, 8, 0.25)

mu_notafrica <- link(m7_4, data = data.frame(cont_africa = 0, 
                                             rugged = rugged_seq))
mu_africa <- link(m7_4, data = data.frame(cont_africa = 1, 
                                          rugged = rugged_seq))

mu_notafrica_mean <- apply(mu_notafrica, 2, mean)
mu_notafrica_pi <- apply(mu_notafrica, 2, PI, prob = 0.97) %>% pi_to_df()

mu_africa_mean <- apply(mu_africa, 2, mean)
mu_africa_pi <- apply(mu_africa, 2, PI, prob = 0.97) %>% pi_to_df()

bind_rows(
    tibble(cont_africa = "not Africa", 
           rugged = rugged_seq, 
           mu = mu_notafrica_mean) %>%
        bind_cols(mu_notafrica_pi),
    tibble(cont_africa = "Africa", 
           rugged = rugged_seq, 
           mu = mu_africa_mean) %>%
        bind_cols(mu_africa_pi)
) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = rugged)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = x2_percent, ymax = x98_percent, fill = cont_africa), 
                alpha = 0.2, color = NA) +
    geom_line(aes(y = mu, color = cont_africa), size = 1.1) +
    geom_point(data = dd, aes(y = log_gdp), size = 1, color = "lightblue4") +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
    theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.8)) +
    labs(x = "terrain ruggedness index",
         y = "log GDP year 2000",
         color = NULL, fill = NULL,
         title = "Model of GDP by ruggedness with a dummy variable for continent",
         subtitle = "One line for in and out of Africa with the 97% interval.")
```

### 7.1.2 Adding a linear interaction does work

- we have just used the model below:

$$
Y_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_R R_i + \beta_A A_i
$$

- now we want to allow the relationship of $Y$ and $R$ to vary as a function of $A$
    * add in $\gamma$ as a placeholder for another linear function that defines the slope between GDP and ruggedness
    * this is the *linear interaction effect*
    * explicitly modeling that the slope between GDP and ruggedness is *conditional upon* whether or not a nation is in Africa

$$
Y_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i = \alpha + \gamma_i R_i + \beta_A A_i \\
\gamma_i = \beta_R + \beta_{AR}A_i
$$

- rearranging the above forumla results in the following

$$
\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_R R_i + \beta_{AR} A_i R_i + \beta_A A_i
$$

- fit the model using `quap()` like normal

```{r}
m7_5 <- quap(
    alist(
        log_gdp ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
        mu <- a + gamma*rugged + bA*cont_africa,
        gamma <- bR + bAR*cont_africa,
        a ~ dnorm(8, 100),
        c(bA, bR, bAR) ~ dnorm(0, 1),
        sigma ~ dunif(0, 10)
    ),
    data = dd
)

precis(m7_5)
plot(precis(m7_5))
```

- the new model is far better than the previous two

```{r}
compare(m7_3, m7_4,  m7_5)
```

### 7.1.3 Plotting the interaction

- nothing new, just make two plots, one for African and one for non-African

```{r}
rugged_seq <- seq(-1, 8, 0.25)

mu_africa <- link(m7_5, 
                  data = data.frame(cont_africa = 1, rugged = rugged_seq))
mu_africa_mean <- apply(mu_africa$mu, 2, mean)
mu_africa_pi <- apply(mu_africa$mu, 2, PI, prob = 0.97) %>% pi_to_df()

mu_notafrica <- link(m7_5, 
                     data = data.frame(cont_africa = 0, rugged = rugged_seq))
mu_notafrica_mean <- apply(mu_notafrica$mu, 2, mean)
mu_notafrica_pi <- apply(mu_notafrica$mu, 2, PI, prob = 0.97) %>% pi_to_df()

bind_rows(
    tibble(cont_africa = "not Africa", 
           rugged = rugged_seq, 
           mu = mu_notafrica_mean) %>%
        bind_cols(mu_notafrica_pi),
    tibble(cont_africa = "Africa", 
           rugged = rugged_seq, 
           mu = mu_africa_mean) %>%
        bind_cols(mu_africa_pi)
) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = rugged)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = x2_percent, ymax = x98_percent, fill = cont_africa), 
                alpha = 0.2, color = NA) +
    geom_line(aes(y = mu, color = cont_africa), size = 1.1) +
    geom_point(data = dd, aes(y = log_gdp), size = 1, color = "lightblue4") +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
    theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.8)) +
    labs(x = "terrain ruggedness index",
         y = "log GDP year 2000",
         color = NULL, fill = NULL,
         title = "Model of GDP by ruggedness with an interaction term for continent",
         subtitle = "One line for in and out of Africa with the 97% interval.")
```

### 7.1.4 Interpreting the interaction estimate

- helpful to plot implied predictions
- often only numbers are reported, though they are difficult to interpret because:
    * the parameters have different meanings because they are no longer independent
    * it is very difficult to propagate the uncertainty when trying to understand multiple parameters simultaneously
- remember that the interaction term $y$ is a distribution
    * we can sample from it for African and non-African countries

```{r}
post <- extract.samples(m7_5)
gamma_africa <- post$bR + post$bAR*1
gamma_notafrica <- post$bR + post$bAR*0

tibble(Africa = gamma_africa,
       `not Africa` = gamma_notafrica) %>%
    pivot_longer(everything()) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
    geom_density(aes(fill = name, color = name), alpha = 0.3) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
    labs(x = "posterior etimates of gamma",
         y = "probability density",
         title = "Probability distribution for the estimates of gamma",
         subtitle = "Gamma is the slope of the interaction term")
```

- can use these estimates like normal:
    * e.g.: what is the probability that the slope within Africa is less than the slope outside of Africa

```{r}
# The probability that the slope within Africa is less than that outside.
sum(gamma_africa < gamma_notafrica) / length(gamma_africa)
```

## 7.2 Symmetry of the linear interaction

- the interaction term we have fit has two different phrasings:
    1. "How much does the influence of ruggedness (on GDP) depend upon whether the nation is in Africa?"
    2. How much does the influence of being in Africa (on GDP) depend upon ruggedness?
- the model interprets these as the same statement

7.2.1 Buridan's interaction

- the model's formula can be rearranged
    * the same  model can be reformulated to group the $A_i$ terms together
    * shows that *linear interactions are symmetric*

$$
Y_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i = \alpha + \gamma_i R_i + \beta_A A_i \\
\gamma_i = \beta_R + \beta_{AR}A_i \\
\ \\
\mu_i = \alpha + (\beta_R + \beta_{AR}A_i) R_i + \beta_A A_i \\
\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_R R_i + \beta_{AR}A_i R_i + \beta_A A_i \\
\ \\
\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_R R_i + (\beta_{AR} R_i + \beta_A) A_i \\
$$

### 7.2.2 Africa depends upon ruggedness

- below is a plot of the reverse interpretation of the interaction term
    * the x-axis is now whether the country is in Africa
    * the points are the ruggedness separated by high and low (usign the median as the cut-off)
    * the blue slope is the expected reduction in log GDP for a non-rugged terrian if it was moved to Africa
    * for countries in very rugged terrains, the continent has little effect

```{r}
q_rugged  <- range(dd$rugged)

mu_ruggedlo <- link(m7_5,
                    data = data.frame(rugged = q_rugged[1],
                                      cont_africa = 0:1))
mu_ruggedlo_mean <- apply(mu_ruggedlo$mu, 2, mean)
mu_ruggedlo_pi <- apply(mu_ruggedlo$mu, 2, PI) %>% pi_to_df()

mu_ruggedhi <- link(m7_5,
                    data = data.frame(rugged = q_rugged[2],
                                      cont_africa = 0:1))
mu_ruggedhi_mean <- apply(mu_ruggedhi$mu, 2, mean)
mu_ruggedhi_pi <- apply(mu_ruggedhi$mu, 2, PI) %>% pi_to_df()

bind_rows(
    tibble(rugged = "low",
           cont_africa = 0:1,
           name = "low",
           mu_rugged = mu_ruggedlo_mean) %>%
        bind_cols(mu_ruggedlo_pi),
    tibble(rugged = "high",
           cont_africa = 0:1,
           mu_rugged = mu_ruggedhi_mean) %>%
        bind_cols(mu_ruggedhi_pi)
) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = cont_africa)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = x5_percent, ymax = x94_percent, 
                    fill = factor(rugged)), alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_line(aes(y = mu_rugged, color = factor(rugged))) +
    geom_jitter(
        data = dd, 
        aes(x = cont_africa, y = log_gdp, 
            color = ifelse(rugged < median(rugged), "low", "high")),
        alpha = 0.4, width = 0.03
    ) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1), labels = c("not Africa", "Africa")) +
    labs(x = NULL,
         y  = "log GDP year 2000",
         fill = "ruggedness", color = "ruggedness",
         title = "Symmetric interpretation of the interaction term")
```

- it is simultaneously true that:
    1. the influence of ruggedness depends on the continent
    2. the influence of continent depends in the ruggedness

## 7.3 Continuous interactions

- interaction effects are difficult to interpret
    * especially with only tables of posterior means and std. devs.
    * we will look at using a *triptych plot* to understand these effects
- it is very important to center and standardize the predictors when using interactions

### 7.3.1 The data

- for examples we will use sizes of blooms from beds of tulips grown in greenhouses with different soil and light
    * we are interested in the interaction of light and water

```{r}
data("tulips")
d <- as_tibble(tulips)
str(d)
```

### 7.3.2 The un-centered models

- the author demonstrates fitting and interpreting the models without centering the data

### 7.3.3 Center and re-estimate

```{r}
d$shade_c <- d$shade - mean(d$shade)
d$water_c <- d$water - mean(d$water)
```



- fit two models for predicting number of blooms with water and shade
    * the second model includes their interactions
    * starting places for the fitting are provided because the priors are very flat

```{r}
m7_8 <- quap(
    alist(
        blooms ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
        mu <- a + bW*water_c + bS*shade_c,
        a ~ dnorm(130, 100),
        c(bW, bS) ~ dnorm(0, 100),
        sigma ~ dunif(0, 100)
    ),
    data = d,
    start = list(a = mean(d$blooms), 
                 bW = 0, bS = 0, 
                 sigma = sd(d$blooms))
)

m7_9 <- quap(
    alist(
        blooms ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
        mu <- a + bW*water_c + bS*shade_c + bWS*water_c*shade_c,
        a ~ dnorm(130, 100),
        c(bW, bS, bWS) ~ dnorm(0, 100),
        sigma ~ dunif(0, 100)
    ),
    data = d,
    start = list(a = mean(d$blooms), 
                 bW = 0, bS = 0, bWS = 0, 
                 sigma = sd(d$blooms))
)

plot(precis(m7_8))
plot(precis(m7_9))
coeftab(m7_8, m7_9)
compare(m7_8, m7_9)
```

- the main effects are the same between the two models
    * if the predictors were not centered, the coefficient for shade in the model with the interaction would have been positive
- with the data centered, the intercept has meaning - it is the mean number of blooms
- interpretations of the estimates for the model with the interaction term `m7_9`:
    * $\alpha$: the expected value of blooms when both water and shade are at their average values (0 from centering)
    * $\beta_W$: the expected change in blooms when water increases by 1 unit and shade is at its average value
    * $\beta_S$: the expected change in blooms when shade increases by 1 unit and water is at its average value
    * $\beta_{WS}$: the interaction term has multiple interpretations:
        - the expected change in the influence of water on blooms when increasing shade by one unit
        - the expected change in the influence of shade on blooms when increasing water by one unit

### 7.3.4 Plotting implied predictions

- make a *triptych plot* to help understand interactions:
    * plot the bivariate relationship between shade and blooms
    * each of the 3 plots will show predictions for different values of water

```{r}
shade_seq <- seq(-1, 1)

purrr::map(seq(-1, 1), function(w) {
    dt <- d[d$water_c == w, ]
    pred_data <- tibble(water_c = w, shade_c = shade_seq)
    mu <- link(m7_9, data = pred_data)
    pred_data %>%
        mutate(mu_mean = apply(mu, 2, mean)) %>%
        bind_cols(apply(mu, 2, PI) %>% pi_to_df())
}) %>%
    bind_rows() %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = shade_c)) +
    facet_wrap(~ water_c) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = x5_percent, ymax = x94_percent), alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_line(aes(y = mu_mean)) +
    geom_point(data = d, aes(y = blooms)) +
    labs(x = "shade (centered)",
         y = "blooms",
         title = "Effect of amount of light on impact of shade on blooms",
         subtitle = "Each panel is a different level of light.")
```

- this makes the interaction of the effects of shade and water easily understandable
    * plot on the left: when there is little water, the impact of shade is negligible
    * plot on the right: when there is plenty of water, the shade has a larger impact on the number of blooms

7.4 Interactions in design formulas

- mathematical formula with an interaction between $x$ and $z$:

$$
y_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_x x_i + \beta_z z_i + \beta_{xz} x_i z_i
$$

```r
# Two equivalent model specifications.
m7_x <- lm(y ~ x + z + x*z, data = d)
m7_x <- lm(y ~ x*z, data = d)
```

- can also remove main effects by subtracting them out
    * useful when we know *a priori* there is know effect of $z$ on $y$

```r
m7_x <- lm(y ~ x + x*z - z, data = d)
```

- can use the following trick to see how R is interpreting a formula

```{r}
x <- z <- w <- 1
colnames(model.matrix(~ x*z*w))
```
