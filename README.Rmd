# Notes on *Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan*

The first two chapters of the 2nd edition of this book are available as a [PDF](statisticalrethinking2_chapters1and2.pdf) for free.
The rest of the book I used the first edition as it is available through my schools library.

## Introduction

This book is an introduction to Bayesian statistics, focussing on providing an applicable education in R.
This reporisoty contains my notes; these notes are not a throughough recapitulation of the book, but instead acting as a combination of a reference and a playground for myself.

This course includes an R packages called 'rethinking']().
It can be installed as follows.
